The `find_path` module holds the basic primitives for
finding paths in a given `Grid`.

Finding a path involves accumulating state (e.g. the series of
points that make up the path).

```rust
use directions::{Direction, DIRECTIONS};
use format::Table;
use grid::{Elem, Grid, Pt, DirVector};
use path::{Closed, Path};

use std::borrow::Cow;

#[derive(Clone)]
struct FindPaths<'a> {
    format: Cow<'a, Table>,
    grid: &'a Grid,
    steps: Vec<Pt>,
}

use std;

impl<'a> std::fmt::Debug for FindPaths<'a> {
    fn fmt(&self, w: &mut std::fmt::Formatter) -> std::fmt::Result {
        write!(w, "PathFinder {{ grid, steps: {:?} }}", self.steps)
    }
}
```

There are a couple different basic strategies for ensure that we
only seek *new* trails when extending a path. We can either:

 * Mutate the grid as we go, e.g. putting blank spaces in every
   non-crossing point that we make part of our current path, so that
   future attempts to traverse that point will cause the path to
   terminate

 * Leave the grid unmutated, and instead query the accumulated
   set of points on each traversal, to see if the point in question
   is already part of our current path.

Note: A crossing point is a place where a path is allow to intersect
another path. A typical ascii-art example is the `+` character, as in:

```
 |
-+-
 |
```

but we might want to select a different one, such as `#`, and reserve
`+` solely for corners in paths. See discussion at [a2s issue 15][].

[a2s issue 15]: https://bitbucket.org/dhobsd/asciitosvg/issues/15/boxes-with-corners-cause-a-memory-leak

I guess the first option could be (arguably) a special case of the
second, if we were to mutate a *local copy* of the grid.

In any case, the main drawback to that variant is that when we
back-track, we will need to restore the grid to its previous
state. The backtracking of the second approach is just a matter of
popping the vector of points that we are building up.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
enum FindContext {
    Start,
    TurnAny(Direction),
    Trajectory(Direction),
}

impl<'a> FindPaths<'a> {
```

Exercise note: When taking only `&Grid`,
the return-type needs to be `FindPaths`, not `Self`.

Some day, It may be worthwhile to make an exercise out of why.
(A strong hint is present in the signature of `fn with_grid_format`)

```rust
    #[cfg(test)]
    fn new(grid: &Grid) -> FindPaths {
        FindPaths {
            format: Default::default(),
            grid: grid,
            steps: vec![],
        }
    }

    fn with_grid_format(grid: &'a Grid, format: &'a Table) -> Self {
        FindPaths {
            format: Cow::Borrowed(format),
            grid: grid,
            steps: vec![],
        }
    }

        Path {
            // it would be nice to figure out an API that converted

            // the path lengths to all be so short that this won't
